# Preface
The vocabularies of Bahasa Indonesia are mostly--if not all--loan words. It is always exciting to find one in a language that I've never thought it would be related. I'm not saying Bahasa Indonesia got that word from that language in particular, but I believe they are related in some ways, directly or indirectly.

So, I've been thinking about writing those words down because they could make an interesting trivia game. I'm just listing them down, I'm not trying to write a dissertation. It's just for fun. For example, the word for "merchant" is "تاجر" (taajir) in Arabic. In Bahasa Indonesia, a slang word for "rich" is "tajir". They are too similar to be not related. One might say that in the past Arabic merchants used to come to Indonesia for selling stuff and they were rich, so the locals might associate the profession with being rich. I don't know though, I don't have evidence. It's just a cocoklogi--reasoning by connecting facts without supporting evidence. Afterall, it's just for fun, I don't care about going deeper.
